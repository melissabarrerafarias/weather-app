Planning a trip and want to know what kind of weather to pack for? You've come to the right place! This week I was challenged to use the OpenWeather API, CSS, HTML, and Javascript 
to provide you with the weather to whatever city you choose. When you search the desired city, you'll find the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV-Index, along with a five-day 
forecast! The little icons will give you a small preview to the weather as well. You'll also notice the color of the UV-Index change according to its status... green being good, yellow moderate, orange moderate/unhealthy, red unhealthy, and purple very unhealthy. Watch out for that! You'll also see every city be added to your search history on the left side. Feel free to click on them again to check the weather once more. Below is a link to the application. Check it out!

Here's what it looks like:
